# Dog rescue redesign UX

## Overview

Throughout the term we’ll be working on the redesign of a complete website, specifically a dog rescue.

We’ll be taking the approach of making a pattern library, where each week we’ll be designing different components of the website.

Near the end of the term we’ll take all those common components and use them to build out a home page, an inside page, and an application form page.

Before we can get started on that stuff we need to do the UX—you’ll be graded on the completeness of your UX as Jed would expect.

## Details

**Choose one of these dog rescues to redesign:**

- [Birch Haven](http://www.birchhaven.org/)
- [Loyal Rescue](http://www.loyalrescue.com/)

Create 1 InVision board with the following pieces of information:

1. Target audience
2. Website goals
3. Competitive analysis
4. Sitemap
5. An updated & refined logo: should work well (or adapt to) these sizes: `256px`, `64px`, `32px`, `16px`
6. Visual design: type, colours, sample components (buttons, cards, etc.)
7. Wireframes: home page, inside page, application form page
  *These should be high-fidelity with some real text—paper is okay but use rulers*
  These are the pages we’ll eventually code

## Marking rubric

Below is the rubric of expectations for this project. **You will be assigned a letter grade based on your standing within the rubric.**

| | 0 points | 1 points | 2 points | 3 points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Target audience** | Incomplete or missing | Rushed & too generic | Specific but obviously lacking research | Specific and appropriate, with good details |
| **Website goals** | Incomplete or missing | Rushed & too generic | Okay, but could be more specific | Specific and cohesive |
| **Competitive analysis** | Incomplete or missing | Only one comparison | A couple comparisons but too light on details | A few good comparisons with a goodly amount of details |
| **Sitemap** | Incomplete or missing | Just a redo of the current site | Better than original site, but lots of important info missing | Complete, organized and simplified from the original site |
| **Logo** | Incomplete or missing | Only works well at one size | Small sizes are inconsistent with large sizes | Cohesive & uniform for all sizes, even if different |
| **Visual design** | Incomplete or missing | Missing important components or poorly executed | Average, could be more cohesive & considered | Cohesive & appropriate with a good sample of components |
| **Home page wireframe** | Incomplete or missing | Missing important pieces or poorly executed | Complete but not detailed enough | Complete, detailed, and a good representation to code from |
| **Inside page wireframe** | Incomplete or missing | Missing important pieces or poorly executed | Complete but not detailed enough | Complete, detailed, and a good representation to code from |
| **Application form page wireframe** | Incomplete or missing | Missing important pieces or poorly executed | Complete but not detailed enough | Complete, detailed, and a good representation to code from |
| **Professionalism** | Rushed & poorly done | Okay | Average, could use more time spent | Clearly demonstrated lots of effort and consideration |
